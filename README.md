# Sentiment-Analysis-Tool
This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis tool with a user-friendly GUI. It allows users to load text data, preprocess it, extract features using TF-IDF, and train a Logistic Regression model to classify sentiments. The tool also visualizes the confusion matrix to help users understand the modelâ€™s performance.
